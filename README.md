### Purpose

This app is was created to learn about Socket.io, Redux, CodeMirror, and IFrame's practical uses inside a full-stack React application.

### Basic Use
Users can register and login with unique usernames, or head straight to the code editor by using the "Try It Out!" button.
Once on the home page, all code typed into the editor will be live-rendered in the adjacent frame. If nothing renders, it means there is a bug in your code!

After creating a sketch you can save it, open it again, edit it, and save those changes.

### "Forking" Other Sketches
Users can see sketches other people have made. The app will not leave you save other sketches. If you try, the app will notify you with an error, and the save button will re-render as an "Add Sketch" button with an input field for the sketch name.

### Pair Programming
 To begin pair programming, simply select a room using the "Select Room" button and enter a unique room name. If another user enters that same identifier, all code entered on their client will be simultaneously typed in your client. To leave, simply click the "Leave Room" button.
